1. Project Description:

1.1 CROSS-SELL
Cross-selling is the practice of marketing additional products to existing customers, often practiced in the financial services industry. Financial advisers can often earn additional revenue by cross-selling additional products and services to their existing client base.In our case, for an insurance company that provides medical insurance to its customers wanted to know how many of their existing policyholders (customers) from last year will also be interested in Vehicle Insurance provided by the company.

1.2 SMART Problem
Whether a customer would be interested in an additional insurance service like vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimize its business model and revenue. From our EDA, we found that vehicle damage, previously insured and vehicle age have significant impact on whether a customer will buy vehicle insurance or not. Weâ€™ll use this understanding to build a classification model.
